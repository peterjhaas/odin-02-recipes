    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        As someone who grew up on dusty, brown food co-op lentils, tasting new-crop lentils was a rvelation.  They have an interesting texture, excellent flavor, and they cook lightening fast, at least compared to other beans.  These <em>Black Caviar Lentils</em> have a little something extra that makes me sigh with a tinge of regret when I eat them: Why don't I make them more often? In my case, it's because I have 35 other varieties of legumes to rotate through, but these are one of my favorites.
    </p>
    <p>
        We don't mention as often as we should, but once cooked, they're cute!  I love a little mound of them on a composed salad.  Theyre also great in a salt of grated carrots.  The orange carrots and black lentils make for a good platter!

        "Every day it seems like there's a new startup claiming that high-protein cricket flour will heal the world, that we're supposedly on the verge of agolden age of lab-grown meat.  When I hear about stuff like that lately, I can't help but think: when we've got lentils this good, why go through the trouble?" --- Chris Cohen in <em>Saveur Magazine</em> on Rancho Gordo Black Caviar Lentils.

    <p>
        This seems like a great side dish to serve with fish or chicken, but could also be delicous tossed with fresh pasta.  Roast some extra cherry tomatoes if you can --- they are flavor-packed jewels that can be used in salads, pasta, and of course, with your favorite legumes.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 garlic gloves, minced, plus 1 whole garlic clove</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked <a href="#">Rancho Gordo Black Caviar Lentils</a>, picked over and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>6 to 8 ounches fresh mozzarella balls (<em>bocconcini</em>)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon good-quality balsamic vinegar, plus more if needed.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Makes 4 side servings</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Prehead the oven to 350Â°F.  In a baking dish large enough to hold the tomoates in a single layer, mix the tomatoes with about 2 tablespoons olive oil, the minced garlic, and a generous pinch of salt.  Arrange the tomatoes cut side up and roast until they start to shrivel and caramelize, 30 to 45 minutes.
    </li>

    <li>
        Meanwhile, cook the lentils: Place in a pot and add enough water to cover by about 2 inches.  Add the bay leaf and the whole garlic clove.  Bring to a full boil, then reduce heat to a gentle simmer, using a lid to help regulate the heat, and gently cook until done, 25 to 30 minutes.  Drain excess liquid, then salt and pepper to taste.
    </li>
    <li> 
        Remove the baking dish from the oven and add the cooked lentils, cheese, and vinegar; gently combine.  Drizzle with more olive oil.  Bake for another 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove from the oven and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and more balsamic vinegar, if desired.  Add the basil and genly toss.  Serve warm.
    </li>
    </ul>
