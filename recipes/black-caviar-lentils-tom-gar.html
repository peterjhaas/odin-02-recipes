 <h1>Black Caviar Lentil</h1>
    <p>
        As someone who grew up on dusty, brown food co-op lentils, tasting new-crop lentils was a rvelation.  They have an interesting texture, excellent flavor, and they cook lightening fast, at least compared to other beans.  These <em>Black Caviar Lentils</em> have a little something extra that makes me sigh with a tinge of regret when I eat them: Why don't I make them more often? In my case, it's because I have 35 other varieties of legumes to rotate through, but these are one of my favorites.

        We don't mention as often as we should, but once cooked, they're cute!  I love a little mound of them on a composed salad.  Theyre also great in a salt of grated carrots.  The orange carrots and black lentils make for a good platter!

        "Every day it seems like there's a new startup claiming that high-protein cricket flour will heal the world, that we're supposedly on the verge of agolden age of lab-grown meat.  When I hear about stuff like that lately, I can't help but think: when we've got lentils this good, why go through the trouble?" --- Chris Cohen in <em>Saveur Magazine</em> on Rancho Gordo Black Caviar Lentils.

    <h1>Black Caviar Lentils with Roasted Tomatoes and Garlic</h1>
    <p>
        This seems like a great side dish to serve with fish or chicken, but could also be delicous tossed with fresh pasta.  Roast some extra cherry tomatoes if you can --- they are flavor-packed jewels that can be used in salads, pasta, and of course, with your favorite legumes.
