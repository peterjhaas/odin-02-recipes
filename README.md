# odin-02-recipes
PJH's crack at the Odin Project's recipe assignment.  In this project we'll be building a simple website to display some recipes.

## First Pass
The first edition of this project will demonstrate my ability to combine basic HTML coding skills along with a standard GITHUB workflow.
