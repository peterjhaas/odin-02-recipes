        Isn't it amazing how in the worst of times, making food is one of the greatest comforts?  Nothing makes sense except those moments in the kitchen when you know for sure that the onions and the garlic in the olive oil are the start of something good.  you can control that.  Good beans, pure water, some salt, and time.  Suddenly you're in control and maybe the world doesn't make much sense but your pot of beans will deliver.  you're self sufficient.  You are taking care of yourself and some lucky friends and family.
